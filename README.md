# HELLO PERLIS 

This is a simple, single file PHP plugin shamelessly based on Matt Mullenweg's 'Hello Dolly' plugin, which write random lyrics to the upper right corner of your WordPress.org admin screen. Instead of showtunes, we're going to see the famous 'Epigrams on Programming' by Alan J. Perlis (**ACM SIGPLAN Notices**, September 1982).

## Installation

FTP into your Wordpress install and navigate to the Plugins folder:

 > wp-content > plugins

Upload the file here, then return to your admin screen to enable.

## Usage

Look to the upper right of your admin screen whenever you want to meditate on the deeper questions of programming (or smile at his wry humor).

That's it!.
